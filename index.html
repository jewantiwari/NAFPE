Call to Action:
As Americans of Nepalese origin, we not only have the freedom to participate in the U.S.
political processes; we also have the civic responsibility to do so. The Forum is dedicated to
promoting and assisting the political involvement of all Nepalese Americans.
 
The Forum actively encourages our youth to participate in civic affairs. Scholarships to be
established to support the Forum’s youth internship program.
 
The Forum is committed to building bridges instead of fences. We can continue to do this only
with your help. Become involved in the Forum and in the political process. Help us build a bridge
of understanding for all Nepalese Americans.
The Forum is always hard at work to provide opportunities for our community to stay involved.

 Hold a “coffee” for a local candidate running for election. Call the candidate and your friends to
discuss current issues and your concerns.
 Help a candidate in campaign work, call her/him to offer your help.
 Sponsor a fund raiser for your favorite candidate. Call your friends and tell them why your candidate
should be supported.
 It is said every letter written is worth 100 votes. Write a letter to your congressman, senator, state
representative on issues that matter to you and ask for support on causes which matter to you.
Congratulate them for the actions they took of which you approve and give them reasons if you
disapprove. Your elected officials want to hear from you.
